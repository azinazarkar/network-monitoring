## Monitoring Network Packets 
by running this program, it shows some information about the packet. The information contains the destination and source MAC address for the
packet, the ethernet frame and the protocol name. (Till now It just understands 4 protocols, I'll add
 the rest later.) For TCP protocol, it provides source port and destination port.

## How To Run
The program requires linux OS (I know it's crazy but whatever). For running the program 
make sure you have root access. You can use the following command : 

```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```
